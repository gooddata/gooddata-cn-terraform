# Conventional Commits Policy

- Format every commit message per https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
- Structure: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>` (e.g., `feat(api): add reporting endpoint`).
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`.
- Mark breaking changes with `!` after type/scope or add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- Keep descriptions concise and lowercase; add body/footers when extra context is needed.
