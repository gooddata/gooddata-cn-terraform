# Test Scripts Cleanup and Optimization

## Scripts Removed ❌

### 1. `azure/create-storage-secret.sh` - DELETED
**Why removed:**
- Created incorrect secret name (`azure-storage-credentials` vs `gooddata-cn-secrets`)
- Used hardcoded storage account name and key
- Functionality now handled by Terraform automatically
- No longer needed in automated deployment workflow

### 2. `azure/simple-storage-test.sh` - DELETED  
**Why removed:**
- Hardcoded specific pod names that change between deployments
- Used brittle pod selection that breaks when pods are recreated
- Limited testing scope - only checked local storage
- Outdated approach that doesn't test Azure Blob Storage integration

### 3. `storage-test.sh` (root level) - DELETED
**Why removed:**
- Used Azure AD authentication (`--auth-mode login`) which doesn't work from cluster
- Attempted to access storage without proper credentials
- Duplicated functionality with inferior implementation
- Located in wrong directory (root instead of azure/)

## Script Improved ✅

### `azure/test-azure-blob-integration.sh` - ENHANCED

**Major Improvements Made:**

#### 1. **Dynamic Configuration**
```bash
# Before: Hardcoded values
STORAGE_ACCOUNT="gooddatacnpoc4f49c5"
RESOURCE_GROUP="gooddata-cn-poc-rg"

# After: Dynamic from Terraform
STORAGE_ACCOUNT=$(terraform output -raw azure_storage_account_name 2>/dev/null || echo "gooddatacnpoc4f49c5")
RESOURCE_GROUP=$(terraform output -raw azure_resource_group_name 2>/dev/null || echo "gooddata-cn-poc-rg")
```

#### 2. **Better Error Handling**
```bash
# Added at start
set -e  # Exit on any error

# Enhanced validation
if [ -z "$STORAGE_KEY" ]; then
    echo "❌ Failed to retrieve storage account key"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### 3. **Improved Pod Health Checks**
```bash
# Dynamic pod counting instead of hardcoded names
QUIVER_PODS=$(kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/subcomponent=quiver-cache -n gooddata-cn --no-headers | wc -l)
RUNNING_PODS=$(kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/subcomponent=quiver-cache -n gooddata-cn --no-headers | grep Running | wc -l)
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Security**
```bash
# Dynamic key retrieval instead of hardcoded credentials
STORAGE_KEY=$(az storage account keys list --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query "[0].value" --output tsv 2>/dev/null)
```

#### 5. **Better User Experience**
- Added step numbering and clear progress indicators
- Enhanced success/failure messages with emojis
- Improved final summary with actionable next steps
- Added specific monitoring commands for ongoing usage

#### 6. **Comprehensive Testing Flow**
1. ✅ Check Helm configuration
2. ✅ Verify secret mounting  
3. ✅ Check pod health
4. ✅ Get storage credentials dynamically
5. ✅ Test cluster storage access
6. ✅ Verify blob connectivity
7. ✅ Check container contents
8. ✅ Test blob creation/deletion
9. ✅ Check quiver logs
10. ✅ Cleanup and summary

## Supporting Infrastructure Added ✅

### Terraform Outputs Enhanced
Added to `azure/outputs.tf`:
```hcl
output "azure_storage_account_name" {
  description = "Azure Storage Account name for GoodData.CN"
  value       = azurerm_storage_account.main.name
}

output "azure_resource_group_name" {
  description = "Azure Resource Group name" 
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
}
```

## Final Result 🎯

### Before Cleanup:
- **4 test scripts** with varying quality and functionality
- **Hardcoded configurations** that break between deployments  
- **Manual secret management** required
- **Inconsistent testing approaches**
- **Limited error handling**

### After Cleanup:
- **1 comprehensive test script** that handles all scenarios
- **Dynamic configuration** from Terraform outputs
- **Automated secret retrieval** 
- **Robust error handling** with clear feedback
- **Production-ready testing** with actionable results

## Usage

### Run the Enhanced Test Script:
```bash
cd azure/
./test-azure-blob-integration.sh
```

### Expected Output:
```
=== Test Results Summary ===
Storage account: gooddatacnpoc4f49c5
Resource group: gooddata-cn-poc-rg

✅ S3 durable storage configuration is applied to GoodData.CN
✅ Azure Storage credentials are properly mounted as secrets
✅ Azure Blob Storage containers are accessible from the cluster
✅ Blob creation/deletion test successful
✅ Quiver cache pods are running and healthy

🎯 Azure Blob Storage Integration: READY FOR PRODUCTION USE
```

## Benefits Achieved ✨

1. **Reliability**: No more broken tests due to hardcoded values
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for testing
3. **Automation**: Fully integrated with Terraform workflow
4. **Clarity**: Clear pass/fail indicators with helpful guidance
5. **Security**: No hardcoded credentials in scripts
6. **Scalability**: Works across different environments and deployments

The cleanup has transformed a collection of inconsistent, brittle test scripts into a single, robust, production-ready validation tool that integrates seamlessly with the Terraform-managed Azure Blob Storage implementation.
